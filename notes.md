TO DO

// 1. Set up a REPO in github & create unique name 
// 1a. clone to local machine
// 1b. Open folder in VS Code
// 2c. create folder structure and basic README file structure

// 2. install packages 
// 2a. node
// 2b. npm 
// 2c. npm i inquirer@8.2.4
// 2d. pg package
// 2e. install express application
Youâ€™ll need to use the pg package to connect to your PostgreSQL database and perform queries, and the Inquirer package to interact with the user via the command line.

3. Connect to database
3a. to login to sql, psql -U postgres & enter password
3b. \list to see how many databases you have or 'open'
3c. you can technically now input SELECT * FROM database_name.db, however there is aother way
and that's through a .SQL file (aka schema.sql)
